Neuronpedia catalogs millions of these features with automated explanations and example activations, letting us explore what concepts a model has learned.\n\nWe'll use **GPT-2 Small** to explore how SAE features activate on **puns**—looking for features that might encode humor, wordplay, or dual meanings.\n\n## References\n- [Neuronpedia](https://www.neuronpedia.org/)\n- [Neuronpedia Documentation](https://docs.neuronpedia.org/)\n- [Sparse Autoencoders paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08600)"

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SAE Features** decompose model activations into (hopefully) interpretable units\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Neuronpedia** catalogs millions of features with automated explanations and examples\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Search** helps find features related to specific concepts like humor or wordplay\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Puns are challenging** because they require understanding that a word activates multiple meaning-related features simultaneously\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions to Consider\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do puns activate \"humor\" features, or just multiple literal-meaning features?\n",
    "- Can you find features that specifically capture ambiguity or double meanings?\n",
    "- How do feature activations differ between pun and literal uses of the same word?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explore the Neuronpedia web interface for hands-on feature browsing\n",
    "2. Use the inference client to find features on your own text\n",
    "3. Try steering to see if boosting \"humor\" features changes model behavior"
